# Deep-Learning-Modules
This contains the implementation of various deep learning modules.
## Initialization.ipynb 
This notebook explaines the concept such as follows:
  A well chosen initialization can:
  1.Speed up the convergence of gradient descent
  2.Increase the odds of gradient descent converging to a lower training (and generalization) error
  3.To get started, run the following cell to load the packages and the planar dataset you will try to classify.
 The notebook contains examples of various outputs received when different initialization methods are used
 
 ## Gradient Checking
