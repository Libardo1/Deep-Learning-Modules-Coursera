# Deep-Learning-Modules
This contains the implementation of various deep learning modules.
## Initialization.ipynb 
This notebook explaines the concept such as follows:
  A well chosen initialization can:
  1.Speed up the convergence of gradient descent
  2.Increase the odds of gradient descent converging to a lower training (and generalization) error
  3.To get started, run the following cell to load the packages and the planar dataset you will try to classify.
 The notebook contains examples of various outputs received when different initialization methods are used
 
 ## Gradient_Checking.ipynb
  This notebook explains how really certain we can be that the implementation of backpropagation is correct. 
 
 ## Regularization.ipynb
 This notebook contains an implementation of regularization used for Hyperparameter Tuning in a NN.
 
 ## Convolution_NN_Application.ipynb and Convolution _NN_StepByStep.ipynb
 These notebooks contain applications of Convolutional NN applied to solve a problem and how to implement it from scratch.
